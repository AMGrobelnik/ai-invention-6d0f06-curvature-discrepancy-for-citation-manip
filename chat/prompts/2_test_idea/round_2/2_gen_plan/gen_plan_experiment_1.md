title: Testing Curvature Discrepancy for Citation Manipulation Detection
hypothesis: >-
  We hypothesize that citation manipulation patterns create detectable geometric signatures in the discrepancy between Ollivier-Ricci
  and Forman-Ricci curvature, but this remains to be empirically validated. This iteration acquired three citation network
  datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) and conducted literature reviews on curvature computation methods and detection baselines.
  The next step is to compute both curvature measures on these datasets, simulate manipulation patterns following the ACTION
  protocol, and evaluate whether curvature discrepancy achieves AUC-ROC >80% with statistical validation (confidence intervals,
  significance testing). A critical requirement is real-world validation beyond synthetic simulations - we must evaluate on
  retracted papers or expert-labeled manipulation cases, not just simulated anomalies. The technical contribution is currently
  thin (computing two curvatures and taking their difference), so we should either: (1) strengthen theoretical foundation
  with mathematical bounds on discrepancy under manipulation models, or (2) position as a proof-of-concept/short paper acknowledging
  moderate novelty. The method's claimed advantages (computational efficiency O(N*E), interpretability) require verification
  through actual experiments and comparison against simple baselines (graph statistics, unsupervised anomaly detection) not
  just complex neural methods. The success criteria are: (1) curvature discrepancy achieves >80% AUC-ROC with statistical
  validation on simulated data, (2) evaluation on at least one real-world manipulation dataset, (3) comparison against 3+
  diverse baselines including simple methods, (4) correction of the Forman-Ricci formula error identified by reviewers, and
  (5) provision of interpretability case studies showing examples of high-discrepancy edges.
motivation: >-
  Citation manipulation undermines the integrity of scientific metrics and evaluation systems. Existing methods for detecting
  anomalous citations rely primarily on network representation learning, community detection, or content analysis - but they
  fail to capture the subtle geometric signatures that manipulation leaves in the network's curvatur e structure. By introducing
  a simple, interpretable geometric feature (curvature discrepancy) that leverages the complementary information from two
  different curvature notions, we can detect manipulation patterns that single-measure methods miss. This approach is also
  computationally efficient (both curvatures can be computed in O(N*E) complexity) and provides a new geometric perspective
  on citation network analysis.
assumptions:
- >-
  Legitimate citations follow a predictable relationship between Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature that can be characterized
  as a baseline distribution
- >-
  Citation manipulation (cartels, rings, quid-pro-quo exchanges) creates local structural patterns that affect the two curvature
  measures differently, producing detectable discrepancies
- >-
  The curvature discrepancy signal is robust to noise and can be separated from legitimate citation variability
- >-
  Standard citation network datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) provide sufficient scale and realism to validate the approach
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Compute Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Forman-Ricci curvature for edges in standard citation network datasets (Cora, CiteSeer,
  PubMed). 2. Calculate curvature discrepancy features (ratio, difference, z-score) for each edge. 3. Simulate citation manipulation
  patterns (create synthetic citation cartels, inject self-citation rings) to generate ground-truth anomalous edges. 4. Train
  a simple classifier (logistic regression or random forest) on curvature discrepancy features to detect anomalous edges.
  5. Compare against baseline methods (ACTION, CIDRE, single-curvature methods) on precision, recall, F1-score. 6. Analyze
  computational efficiency (runtime, memory) compared to baseline methods.
success_criteria: >-
  1. The curvature discrepancy feature achieves >85% AUC-ROC for detecting simulated citation manipulation edges. 2. The method
  outperforms single-curvature baselines (Ollivier-Ricci only, Forman-Ricci only) by >5% in F1-score. 3. The method runs in
  O(N*E) complexity and processes the PubMed dataset (20K nodes, 90K edges) in <10 minutes on standard hardware. 4. The approach
  detects at least 2 types of manipulation patterns (cartels, rings) that baseline methods miss.
related_works:
- >-
  ACTION (Anomalous Citations detecTion In academic networks via actiOn) - Liu et al. 2024: Uses non-negative matrix factorization
  and network representation learning to detect anomalous citations. Our approach differs by using geometric curvature features
  instead of representation learning, providing a more interpretable and computationally efficient solution.
- >-
  CIDRE (Citation network anomaly detection) - Kojaku et al. 2021: Detects anomalous groups of journals exchanging citations.
  Our approach operates at the edge level (not group level) and uses curvature discrepancy as the detection signal.
- >-
  CurvGAD (Curvature-based Graph Anomaly Detection) - Grover et al. 2025: Uses mixed-curvature graph autoencoder for general
  graph anomaly detection. Our approach is simpler (computes curvature discrepancy directly), focuses specifically on citation
  networks, and does not require training a complex neural network.
- >-
  Comparative analysis of two discretizations of Ricci curvature - Samal et al. 2018: Compares Ollivier-Ricci vs Forman-Ricci
  curvature but does NOT use their discrepancy for anomaly detection. Our hypothesis is the first to propose curvature discrepancy
  as a detection feature.
- >-
  Detecting network anomalies using Forman-Ricci curvature - Chatterjee et al. 2021: Uses single (Forman-Ricci) curvature
  for brain network anomaly detection. Our approach uses BOTH curvatures and their discrepancy, capturing complementary information
  that a single curvature misses.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis was inspired by the observation that Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature capture different structural
  properties of networks (Ollivier-Ricci is based on optimal transport and captures local connectivity/citation flow, while
  Forman-Ricci is combinatorial and captures higher-order clustering). In geometric analysis, when two different measures
  of the same underlying phenomenon disagree, this often signals anomaly. This cross-field insight from Riemannian geometry
  (where curvature discrepancy signals geometric transitions) was adapted to citation networks. The approach also draws inspiration
  from anomaly detection in brain networks (where curvature changes signal disease) and from the broad pattern of 'discrepancy
  features' in machine learning (where the difference between two views of data often reveals outliers).
terms:
- term: Ollivier-Ricci curvature
  definition: >-
    A discrete notion of Ricci curvature for graphs based on optimal transport theory. For an edge (u,v), it measures how
    much the probability distributions of random walks starting from u and v overlap after one step, capturing local 'transport'
    properties of the citation flow.
- term: Forman-Ricci curvature
  definition: >-
    A combinatorial notion of Ricci curvature for graphs based on the graph Laplacian and higher-order simplices. It captures
    how well-connected an edge is in terms of the clustering and triangle structure around it.
- term: Curvature discrepancy
  definition: >-
    The difference or ratio between Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature for an edge. Large discrepancies indicate that
    the local transport properties (Ollivier-Ricci) and the clustering properties (Forman-Ricci) of an edge are inconsistent,
    which can signal anomalous citation patterns.
- term: Citation cartel
  definition: >-
    A group of authors or journals that systematically cite each other's work to inflate citation counts and impact factors,
    creating artificial citation patterns that differ from organic citation practices.
- term: Edge-level anomaly detection
  definition: >-
    The task of identifying individual edges (citations) that are anomalous or manipulated, as opposed to node-level or group-level
    anomaly detection.
summary: >-
  We propose using the discrepancy between Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature as a simple, interpretable geometric
  feature to detect citation manipulation patterns (cartels, rings) in academic networks. The method is novel (first to use
  curvature discrepancy for citation analysis), feasible (O(N*E) complexity), and captures complementary structural signals
  that single-measure methods miss.

approach: >-
  Use GraphRicciCurvature library to compute curvatures on Cora/CiteSeer/PubMed. First, verify and correct the Forman-Ricci
  formula against the original source and library implementation. Simulate anomalies using ACTION protocol with 10 different
  random seeds. Compute AUC-ROC with 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapping. Perform paired t-tests to compare against
  baselines (single curvatures, graph statistics like betweenness/Jaccard/Adamic-Adar, unsupervised methods like LOF/isolation
  forest). Perform k-fold cross-validation (k=5) for robust performance estimation. Compute effect sizes (Cohen's d) for baseline
  comparisons. Conduct runtime comparison on same hardware with detailed breakdown. Perform sensitivity analysis for hyperparameters.
  Generate interpretability case studies: identify 10 high-discrepancy edges and 10 low-discrepancy edges, show their curvature
  values, local neighborhood structure, and explain why they are/aren't anomalous. Create actual figures (ROC curves, discrepancy
  distributions, case study visualizations) as PNG files for the paper. Generate publication-ready tables with mean±std format
  and significance markers.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash

title: Testing Curvature Discrepancy for Citation Manipulation Detection
hypothesis: >-
  We hypothesize that citation manipulation patterns create detectable geometric signatures in the discrepancy between Ollivier-Ricci
  and Forman-Ricci curvature, but this remains to be empirically validated. This iteration acquired three citation network
  datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) and conducted literature reviews on curvature computation methods and detection baselines.
  The next step is to compute both curvature measures on these datasets, simulate manipulation patterns following the ACTION
  protocol, and evaluate whether curvature discrepancy achieves AUC-ROC >80% with statistical validation (confidence intervals,
  significance testing). A critical requirement is real-world validation beyond synthetic simulations - we must evaluate on
  retracted papers or expert-labeled manipulation cases, not just simulated anomalies. The technical contribution is currently
  thin (computing two curvatures and taking their difference), so we should either: (1) strengthen theoretical foundation
  with mathematical bounds on discrepancy under manipulation models, or (2) position as a proof-of-concept/short paper acknowledging
  moderate novelty. The method's claimed advantages (computational efficiency O(N*E), interpretability) require verification
  through actual experiments and comparison against simple baselines (graph statistics, unsupervised anomaly detection) not
  just complex neural methods. The success criteria are: (1) curvature discrepancy achieves >80% AUC-ROC with statistical
  validation on simulated data, (2) evaluation on at least one real-world manipulation dataset, (3) comparison against 3+
  diverse baselines including simple methods, (4) correction of the Forman-Ricci formula error identified by reviewers, and
  (5) provision of interpretability case studies showing examples of high-discrepancy edges.
motivation: >-
  Citation manipulation undermines the integrity of scientific metrics and evaluation systems. Existing methods for detecting
  anomalous citations rely primarily on network representation learning, community detection, or content analysis - but they
  fail to capture the subtle geometric signatures that manipulation leaves in the network's curvatur e structure. By introducing
  a simple, interpretable geometric feature (curvature discrepancy) that leverages the complementary information from two
  different curvature notions, we can detect manipulation patterns that single-measure methods miss. This approach is also
  computationally efficient (both curvatures can be computed in O(N*E) complexity) and provides a new geometric perspective
  on citation network analysis.
assumptions:
- >-
  Legitimate citations follow a predictable relationship between Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature that can be characterized
  as a baseline distribution
- >-
  Citation manipulation (cartels, rings, quid-pro-quo exchanges) creates local structural patterns that affect the two curvature
  measures differently, producing detectable discrepancies
- >-
  The curvature discrepancy signal is robust to noise and can be separated from legitimate citation variability
- >-
  Standard citation network datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) provide sufficient scale and realism to validate the approach
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Compute Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Forman-Ricci curvature for edges in standard citation network datasets (Cora, CiteSeer,
  PubMed). 2. Calculate curvature discrepancy features (ratio, difference, z-score) for each edge. 3. Simulate citation manipulation
  patterns (create synthetic citation cartels, inject self-citation rings) to generate ground-truth anomalous edges. 4. Train
  a simple classifier (logistic regression or random forest) on curvature discrepancy features to detect anomalous edges.
  5. Compare against baseline methods (ACTION, CIDRE, single-curvature methods) on precision, recall, F1-score. 6. Analyze
  computational efficiency (runtime, memory) compared to baseline methods.
success_criteria: >-
  1. The curvature discrepancy feature achieves >85% AUC-ROC for detecting simulated citation manipulation edges. 2. The method
  outperforms single-curvature baselines (Ollivier-Ricci only, Forman-Ricci only) by >5% in F1-score. 3. The method runs in
  O(N*E) complexity and processes the PubMed dataset (20K nodes, 90K edges) in <10 minutes on standard hardware. 4. The approach
  detects at least 2 types of manipulation patterns (cartels, rings) that baseline methods miss.

- >-
  Detecting network anomalies using Forman-Ricci curvature - Chatterjee et al. 2021: Uses single (Forman-Ricci) curvature
  for brain network anomaly detection. Our approach uses BOTH curvatures and their discrepancy, capturing complementary information
  that a single curvature misses.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis was inspired by the observation that Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature capture different structural
  properties of networks (Ollivier-Ricci is based on optimal transport and captures local connectivity/citation flow, while
  Forman-Ricci is combinatorial and captures higher-order clustering). In geometric analysis, when two different measures
  of the same underlying phenomenon disagree, this often signals anomaly. This cross-field insight from Riemannian geometry
  (where curvature discrepancy signals geometric transitions) was adapted to citation networks. The approach also draws inspiration
  from anomaly detection in brain networks (where curvature changes signal disease) and from the broad pattern of 'discrepancy
  features' in machine learning (where the difference between two views of data often reveals outliers).
terms:
- term: Ollivier-Ricci curvature
  definition: >-
    A discrete notion of Ricci curvature for graphs based on optimal transport theory. For an edge (u,v), it measures how
    much the probability distributions of random walks starting from u and v overlap after one step, capturing local 'transport'
    properties of the citation flow.
- term: Forman-Ricci curvature
  definition: >-
    A combinatorial notion of Ricci curvature for graphs based on the graph Laplacian and higher-order simplices. It captures
    how well-connected an edge is in terms of the clustering and triangle structure around it.
- term: Curvature discrepancy
  definition: >-
    The difference or ratio between Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature for an edge. Large discrepancies indicate that
    the local transport properties (Ollivier-Ricci) and the clustering properties (Forman-Ricci) of an edge are inconsistent,
    which can signal anomalous citation patterns.
- term: Citation cartel
  definition: >-
    A group of authors or journals that systematically cite each other's work to inflate citation counts and impact factors,
    creating artificial citation patterns that differ from organic citation practices.
- term: Edge-level anomaly detection
  definition: >-
    The task of identifying individual edges (citations) that are anomalous or manipulated, as opposed to node-level or group-level
    anomaly detection.
summary: >-
  We propose using the discrepancy between Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature as a simple, interpretable geometric
  feature to detect citation manipulation patterns (cartels, rings) in academic networks. The method is novel (first to use
  curvature discrepancy for citation analysis), feasible (O(N*E) complexity), and captures complementary structural signals
  that single-measure methods miss.

  Implement curvature discrepancy method with corrected Forman-Ricci formula, statistical validation, simple baseline comparisons,
  interpretability case studies, and additional statistical evaluation
approach: >-
  Use GraphRicciCurvature library to compute curvatures on Cora/CiteSeer/PubMed. First, verify and correct the Forman-Ricci
  formula against the original source and library implementation. Simulate anomalies using ACTION protocol with 10 different
  random seeds. Compute AUC-ROC with 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapping. Perform paired t-tests to compare against
  baselines (single curvatures, graph statistics like betweenness/Jaccard/Adamic-Adar, unsupervised methods like LOF/isolation
  forest). Perform k-fold cross-validation (k=5) for robust performance estimation. Compute effect sizes (Cohen's d) for baseline
  comparisons. Conduct runtime comparison on same hardware with detailed breakdown. Perform sensitivity analysis for hyperparameters.
  Generate interpretability case studies: identify 10 high-discrepancy edges and 10 low-discrepancy edges, show their curvature
  values, local neighborhood structure, and explain why they are/aren't anomalous. Create actual figures (ROC curves, discrepancy
  distributions, case study visualizations) as PNG files for the paper. Generate publication-ready tables with mean±std format
  and significance markers.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.
