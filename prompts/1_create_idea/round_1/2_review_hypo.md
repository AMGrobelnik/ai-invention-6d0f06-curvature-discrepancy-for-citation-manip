title: Curvature Discrepancy Detects Citation Manipulation
hypothesis: >-
  Citation manipulation patterns (such as citation cartels, self-citation rings, and quid-pro-quo citation exchanges) create
  characteristic signatures in the DISCREPANCY between Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Forman-Ricci curvature that can be detected
  as anomalous patterns. Specifically, legitimate citations produce a predictable relationship between these two curvature
  measures (which capture different structural properties: Ollivier-Ricci captures local transport/citation flow properties
  while Forman-Ricci captures higher-order clustering patterns), whereas manipulated citations create INCONSISTENCIES where
  the two curvature values deviate significantly from their expected relationship. By computing the curvature discrepancy
  (ratio or difference) for each edge in a citation network and tracking its distribution, we can detect edges and substructures
  that exhibit anomalous curvature patterns indicative of citation manipulation.
motivation: >-
  Citation manipulation undermines the integrity of scientific metrics and evaluation systems. Existing methods for detecting
  anomalous citations rely primarily on network representation learning, community detection, or content analysis - but they
  fail to capture the subtle geometric signatures that manipulation leaves in the network's curvatur e structure. By introducing
  a simple, interpretable geometric feature (curvature discrepancy) that leverages the complementary information from two
  different curvature notions, we can detect manipulation patterns that single-measure methods miss. This approach is also
  computationally efficient (both curvatures can be computed in O(N*E) complexity) and provides a new geometric perspective
  on citation network analysis.
assumptions:
- >-
  Legitimate citations follow a predictable relationship between Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature that can be characterized
  as a baseline distribution
- >-
  Citation manipulation (cartels, rings, quid-pro-quo exchanges) creates local structural patterns that affect the two curvature
  measures differently, producing detectable discrepancies
- >-
  The curvature discrepancy signal is robust to noise and can be separated from legitimate citation variability
- >-
  Standard citation network datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) provide sufficient scale and realism to validate the approach
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Compute Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Forman-Ricci curvature for edges in standard citation network datasets (Cora, CiteSeer,
  PubMed). 2. Calculate curvature discrepancy features (ratio, difference, z-score) for each edge. 3. Simulate citation manipulation
  patterns (create synthetic citation cartels, inject self-citation rings) to generate ground-truth anomalous edges. 4. Train
  a simple classifier (logistic regression or random forest) on curvature discrepancy features to detect anomalous edges.
  5. Compare against baseline methods (ACTION, CIDRE, single-curvature methods) on precision, recall, F1-score. 6. Analyze
  computational efficiency (runtime, memory) compared to baseline methods.
success_criteria: >-
  1. The curvature discrepancy feature achieves >85% AUC-ROC for detecting simulated citation manipulation edges. 2. The method
  outperforms single-curvature baselines (Ollivier-Ricci only, Forman-Ricci only) by >5% in F1-score. 3. The method runs in
  O(N*E) complexity and processes the PubMed dataset (20K nodes, 90K edges) in <10 minutes on standard hardware. 4. The approach
  detects at least 2 types of manipulation patterns (cartels, rings) that baseline methods miss.
related_works:
- >-
  ACTION (Anomalous Citations detecTion In academic networks via actiOn) - Liu et al. 2024: Uses non-negative matrix factorization
  and network representation learning to detect anomalous citations. Our approach differs by using geometric curvature features
  instead of representation learning, providing a more interpretable and computationally efficient solution.
- >-
  CIDRE (Citation network anomaly detection) - Kojaku et al. 2021: Detects anomalous groups of journals exchanging citations.
  Our approach operates at the edge level (not group level) and uses curvature discrepancy as the detection signal.
- >-
  CurvGAD (Curvature-based Graph Anomaly Detection) - Grover et al. 2025: Uses mixed-curvature graph autoencoder for general
  graph anomaly detection. Our approach is simpler (computes curvature discrepancy directly), focuses specifically on citation
  networks, and does not require training a complex neural network.
- >-
  Comparative analysis of two discretizations of Ricci curvature - Samal et al. 2018: Compares Ollivier-Ricci vs Forman-Ricci
  curvature but does NOT use their discrepancy for anomaly detection. Our hypothesis is the first to propose curvature discrepancy
  as a detection feature.
- >-
  Detecting network anomalies using Forman-Ricci curvature - Chatterjee et al. 2021: Uses single (Forman-Ricci) curvature
  for brain network anomaly detection. Our approach uses BOTH curvatures and their discrepancy, capturing complementary information
  that a single curvature misses.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis was inspired by the observation that Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature capture different structural
  properties of networks (Ollivier-Ricci is based on optimal transport and captures local connectivity/citation flow, while
  Forman-Ricci is combinatorial and captures higher-order clustering). In geometric analysis, when two different measures
  of the same underlying phenomenon disagree, this often signals anomaly. This cross-field insight from Riemannian geometry
  (where curvature discrepancy signals geometric transitions) was adapted to citation networks. The approach also draws inspiration
  from anomaly detection in brain networks (where curvature changes signal disease) and from the broad pattern of 'discrepancy
  features' in machine learning (where the difference between two views of data often reveals outliers).
terms:
- term: Ollivier-Ricci curvature
  definition: >-
    A discrete notion of Ricci curvature for graphs based on optimal transport theory. For an edge (u,v), it measures how
    much the probability distributions of random walks starting from u and v overlap after one step, capturing local 'transport'
    properties of the citation flow.
- term: Forman-Ricci curvature
  definition: >-
    A combinatorial notion of Ricci curvature for graphs based on the graph Laplacian and higher-order simplices. It captures
    how well-connected an edge is in terms of the clustering and triangle structure around it.
- term: Curvature discrepancy
  definition: >-
    The difference or ratio between Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature for an edge. Large discrepancies indicate that
    the local transport properties (Ollivier-Ricci) and the clustering properties (Forman-Ricci) of an edge are inconsistent,
    which can signal anomalous citation patterns.
- term: Citation cartel
  definition: >-
    A group of authors or journals that systematically cite each other's work to inflate citation counts and impact factors,
    creating artificial citation patterns that differ from organic citation practices.
- term: Edge-level anomaly detection
  definition: >-
    The task of identifying individual edges (citations) that are anomalous or manipulated, as opposed to node-level or group-level
    anomaly detection.
summary: >-
  We propose using the discrepancy between Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvature as a simple, interpretable geometric
  feature to detect citation manipulation patterns (cartels, rings) in academic networks. The method is novel (first to use
  curvature discrepancy for citation analysis), feasible (O(N*E) complexity), and captures complementary structural signals
  that single-measure methods miss.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

name: aii-web-research-tools
description: "Comprehensive web research toolkit — use whenever a task needs MORE than a handful of WebSearch/WebFetch calls (multi-source literature reviews, deep verification across many pages, paper/PDF mining, cross-referencing claims, building bibliographies). Not for single quick lookups — use raw WebSearch/WebFetch for those. Adds aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction over HTML or PDFs (arXiv, journals) with context windows, beyond what WebFetch's lossy summary returns. Trigger: any extensive/comprehensive/deep research task, literature review, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arxiv, paper, PDF, exact quote, methodology, table value, regex."
---

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
